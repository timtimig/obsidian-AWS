#### Shared responsibility model
- AWS is responsible for security "of" the cloud
	- physical security of data centers, private cables between data centers ...
	- up through virtualization, hypervisor level
- Customer is responsible for security "in" the cloud
	- customer data, IAM, firewall config, data encryption, network traffic, updating OS

#### Root User
Sign up happens with an email and a password. This is a root user. A multi-factor auth is needed here. 
Also there is the second set of credentials is called access keys, which allow you to make programmatic requests to AWS API. **Delete your access keys of a root user to stay safe!**
The root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in your account, including your billing and personal information.
**Use a root user only to create a IAM user to manage an account.**
