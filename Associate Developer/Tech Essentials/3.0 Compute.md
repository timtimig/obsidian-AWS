3 types of compute options are available: **virtual machines** (VMs), **container services** and **serverless**.

## [[EC2]] 
is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can provision virtual servers called EC2 instances. Behind the scenes, AWS operates and manages the host machines and the hypervisor layer. AWS also installs the virtual machine operating system, called the guest operating system.

## Container services
AWS offers two container orchestration services: Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon [[ECS]]) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon [[EKS]]).

## Serverless
When running ECS and EKS on Amazon EC2, you are still responsible for maintaining the underlying EC2 instances. Serverless allows run your applications without having to manage any EC2 instances.
There are two options: [[Fargate]] and [[Lambda]]
