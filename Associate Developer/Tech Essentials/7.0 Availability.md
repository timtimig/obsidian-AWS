To increase availability we need redundancy. This typically means more infrastructure - more data centers, more servers, more databases, and more replication of data.

#### Adding a second Availability Zone
The physical location of a server is important. In addition to potential software issues at the operating system (OS) or application level, you must also consider hardware issues. To remedy the physical location issue, you can deploy a second EC2 instance in a second Availability Zone.

However, when there is more than one instance, it brings new challenges:
**Replication process** - the application should know how work with multi instance environment (properties, jobs, cashes etc.)

**Customer redirection** - how clients will send requests to different servers. It might be achieved by DNS or by [[ELB]]. The DNS method isn't always used because of propagation â€” the time frame it takes for DNS changes to be updated across the Internet.

**Types of high availability**:
- active-passive systems: only one of the two instances is available at time. One advantage of this method is that for stateful applications. A disadvantage of an active-passive system is scalability.
- active-active systems: with both servers available, the second server can take some load for the application, and the entire system can take more load.
