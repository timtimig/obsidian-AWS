# Amazon Elastic File System

It is a set-and-forget file system that automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files. EFS can be used with AWS compute services and on-premises resources. You can connect tens, hundreds, and even thousands of compute instances to an EFS file system at the same time.
**Standard storage classes**: FS Standard and EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) offer Multi-AZ resilience and the highest levels of durability and availability.
**One zone storage classes**: EFS One Zone and EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA) provide additional savings by saving your data in a single availability zone.
