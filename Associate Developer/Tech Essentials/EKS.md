# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

If you already use Kubernetes, you can use EKS to orchestrate the workloads in the AWS Cloud. EKS is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
Differences between EKS and ECS:
- In EKS, the machine that runs the containers is called a worker node or Kubernetes node (in ECS a container instance)
- An ECS container is called a task. An EKS container is called a pod
- ECS runs on AWS native technology. EKS runs on Kubernetes.
