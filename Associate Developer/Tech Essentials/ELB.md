## Elastic Load Balancing

Load balancing refers to the process of distributing tasks across a set of resources. A load balancer needs to take all the traffic and redirect it to the backend servers based on an algorithm. The most popular algorithm is round robin, which sends the traffic to each server one after the other.
ELB can distribute incoming application traffic across EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. Because ELB can load balance to IP addresses, it can work in a **hybrid mode**, which means it also load balances to on-premises servers.

#### Health checks
Monitoring is an important part of load balancers because they should route traffic to only healthy EC2 instances. ELB supports two types of health checks as follows:
- Establishing a connection to a backend EC2 instance using TCP and marking the instance as available if the connection is successful
- Making an HTTP or HTTPS request to a resource that you specify and validating that an HTTP response code is returned
After determining the availability of a new EC2 instance, the load balancer starts sending traffic to it. If ELB determines that an EC2 instance is no longer working, it stops sending traffic to it and informs #EC2_Auto_Scaling. The Auto Scaling removes that instance from the group and replace it with a new EC2 instance.

#### ELB components
The ELB service is made up of three main components: rules, listeners, and target groups.

**Rule** - to associate a target group to a listener. Rules are made up of two conditions. The first condition is the source IP address of the client. The second condition decides which target group to send the traffic to.

**Listener**. The client connects to the listener. To define a listener, a port must be provided in addition to the protocol. There can be many listeners for a single load balancer.

**Target group**. Resources are defined in one or more target groups. This is where you define the type of backend you want to direct traffic to, such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or IP addresses. Also, a health check must be defined for each target group.
#### Types of load balancers
We will cover three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Gateway Load Balancer (GLB).
###### Application Load Balancer
It functions at Layer 7 of the OSI model. It's ideal for load balancing HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Key features:
- routes traffic based on request data: paths, hosts, headers and methods, source IP.
- sends responses directly to the client: an Application Load Balancer can reply directly to the client with a fixed response, such as a custom HTML page. It can also send a redirect to the client.
- uses TLS offloading: a load balancer understands HTTPS traffic. To pass HTTPS traffic through an Application Load Balancer, an SSL certificate should be provided.
- authenticates users: can be integrated with various methods such as SAML, LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, others.
- secures traffic: To prevent traffic from reaching the load balancer, you configure a security group to specify the supported IP address ranges.
- supports sticky sessions: if requests must be sent to the same backend server because the application is stateful, use the sticky session feature. This feature uses an HTTP cookie to remember which server to send the traffic to across connections.
###### Network Load Balancer
A Network Load Balancer is ideal for load balancing TCP and UDP traffic. It functions at Layer 4 of the OSI model, routing connections from a target in the target group based on IP protocol data.
###### Gateway Load Balancer
A Gateway Load Balancer helps you to deploy, scale, and manage your third-partyÂ appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems. It provides a gateway for distributing traffic across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them up and down based on demand.
