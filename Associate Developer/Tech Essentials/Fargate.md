Fargate is a serverless compute platform for containers that you can use with either ECS or EKS. Fargate abstracts the EC2 instance so that youâ€™re not required to manage the underlying compute infrastructure.
With Fargate we don't need to worry about patching, scaling, fault tolerance, cluster capacity management, infrastructure manegement.
