#### On-demand instances
You pay for compute capacity per hour or per second.
Recommended for:
- Users who prefer the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without upfront payment or long-term commitments
- Applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

#### Spot instances
For applications that have flexible start and end times. We can get 90% off the On-demand price.
We set a limit on how much you want to pay for the instance hour. If the amount that we pay is more than the current Spot price and there is capacity, you will receive an instance. Spot Instance prices adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply and demand for Spot Instance capacity.
Recommended for:
- Applications that have flexible start and end times
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
- Users with fault-tolerant or stateless workloads

#### Savings Plans
Plans for 1-year or 2-year term commitment.
Recommended for:
- Workloads with a consistent and steady-state usage
- Customers who want to use different instance types and compute solutions across different locations
- Customers who can make monetary commitment to use Amazon EC2 over a 1-year or 3-year term

#### Reserved instances
For applications with steady state usage that might require reserved capacity.

#### Dedicated hosts
A Dedicated Host is a physical Amazon EC2 server that is dedicated for your use.
