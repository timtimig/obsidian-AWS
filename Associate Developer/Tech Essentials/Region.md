Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers. Several availability zones form a region.
How to choose a region:
1. **Compliance**
	- a company is required to handle data and IT resources in a certain way
2. **Latency**
	- how close IT resources to our user base. If there are users far away from region we can use [[CloudFront]] and cache our data. 
3. **Pricing**
	- the pricing can vary from Region to Region
4. **Service availability**
	- not all AWS services are available in all regions
